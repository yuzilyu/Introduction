## Summary
To quote Alan Turing:
> We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done

I am passionate about using my knowledge to solve real-world problems. I am a restorative leader and consistent self-starter. I am dutiful with responsibilities and adapt quickly to new software/framework.
